# Pytorch-GAN-MVTec-AD

The purpose of this repository is to collect Pytorch implementations of different Generative Adversarial Networks presented in research papers. These models are applied to a more complex and realistic dataset, called MVTec.

## MVTec dataset

* The MVTec Anomaly Detection dataset contains 15 categories with 3629 high-resolution images for training and 1725 images for testing. 
* The training set contains only images without defects 
* The test set contains both normal images and images containing different types of defects
* All image resolutions are in the range between 700 x 700 and 1024 x 1024 pixels.
